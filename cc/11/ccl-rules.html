                    <p>Computer Clan Live IRC Rules</p>
                    <p>1. Use Common Sense</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: -10px;">(In a perfect world, that should be ALL WE HAVE TO SAY)</p>
                    <p>Now, for real:</p>
                    <p>1. Do not FLOOD the chat. This means you cannot repeatedly send messages. If you do this, a moderator, or the bot, will kick you from the chat. Repeated offenses will result in a ban.</p>
                    <p>2. Do not SPAM the chat. This means you cannot send links to irrelevant ads, scare sites, malware, viruses, porn, etc. If you do this, a moderator, or the bot, will kick you from the chat. Repeated offenses will result in a ban.</p>
                    <p>3. Do not use BIASED STATEMENTS. This means that you can still share an opinion, but you cannot make the opinion seem like fact. For example, you cannot say 'Android phones suck'. However, you can say 'I do not like Android phones' or 'In my opinion, Android phones don't work for me'. If you do use biased statements, a moderator, or the bot, will kick you from the chat. Repeated offenses will result in a ban.</p>
                    <p>4. Do not use VULGAR LANGUAGE. This means that you cannot say anything inappropriate for a general audience. We have a wide range of demographics for this show. Some viewers are not in their teens, however, some viewers are in their late 20s, and there's everything in between; and more. If any vulgar language is used, the chatroom will automatically censor the language. However, if the language is communicated in such a way that it bypasses the censorship, you will receive a kick, and if the offense is repeated; a ban.</p>
                    <p>5. Do not DISCRIMINATE against race, religion, sexual orientation, etc. If you do this, a moderator, or the bot, will kick you from the chat. Repeated offenses will result in a ban.</p>
                    <p>6. When creating a user name for the chatroom, no not use any vulgar language. Keep the name appropriate for a general audience.</p>

                    <p>Computer Clan Live Call Rules</p>
                    <p>All IRC rules apply here, but here are some additional pointers we would like you to follow. This applies to Computer Clan members who are co-hosting the show, and it applies to guest callers.</p>
                    <p>1. Do not make loud or obnoxious noises on your microphone! This includes:</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: -10px;">Yelling (this causes over-modulation, and that sounds terrible!)</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: -10px;">Eating (yes, microphones pick up on those quiet noises, and they are amplified!)</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: -10px;">Sneezing (we all have to sneeze, but do it away from your mic, or use a mute switch)</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: -10px;">Blowing (wind picks up loudly on a microphone!)</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: -10px;">Burping</p>
                    <p>2. When speaking, speak clearly and professionally. Do not mumble or make random vocal noises during any part of the show. Remember, everyone can hear anything you do when your mic is on.</p>
                    <p>3. If you are in a room that can get noisy at times, please keep in mind that most microphones pick up on background noise! If noise occurs (children yelling, people talking, general around-the-house noises, etc.) please mute your microphone!</p>
                    <p>4. When someone else is talking on the call, please let them finish before you speak. Try not to interrupt other people. Sometimes latency causes issues people's dialogue to overlap, but try not to interrupt to the best of your ability.</p>
                    <p>5. One of the main purposes of this show is to have discussions and talk about technology, tech news, games, etc. If you are not willing to remain in the conversation (i.e. you do not talk frequently) please do not be in the call.</p>
                    <p>6. If the conference call exceeds four callers, we will not be able to allow more callers into the conference call, unless there are extenuating circumstances. Too many callers causes a lot of interruptions on the call, due to latency and other variables.</p>
                    <p>7. If you are on camera (on a video conference) remember that any viewer can see you! Do not make a fool of yourself. Do not perform actions such as flipping off the camera, showing any inappropriate body language or part of the body, etc. In addition, keep your streaming area clean. Any part of the room that appears on camera should be kept clean so your video feed looks more professional. Present yourself like you would in public.</p>
                    <p>Keep in mind professionalism. Remember who you are representing. Everything you say or do on the live show is seen by every viewer, and it is recorded. Make a good reputation for yourself, and for our show.</p>
                    <p>As a note to members and guests, if these rules are not abided by, you will not be allowed on CCL until further notice.</p>
