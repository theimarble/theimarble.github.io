                <p>ABOUT THE SHOW</p>
                <p style="margin-top: -15px;">Imagine a world where technology is alive. In the mysterious place known as the Virtual Barrier, which is the realm between reality and cyberspace, there lives a whole race of intelligence. Anything we see on devices today actually has a life in this world. But it is not all sunshine and lollipops. There is always someone wanting control of the realm, and there is conflict among the Syms, the citizens of the realm.</p>
