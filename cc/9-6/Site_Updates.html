                <p>CC Site 9.6 features in-browser games that run in HTML5. This will be a new thing debuted from the CC. Currently, Windows Crap Edition X, and Cyber Trap are available as a beta. We'll have other releases as we go on. So now, you are no longer restricted to using Windows. Tons of viewers wanted our games, especially our Spoof OS series with Windows Crap Edition, to run on Mac OS X. Now, you can run these games in any HTML5 browser. To check out these HTML5 games, go to Downloads and click Games, or click Windows Crap Edition for the Windows Crap Edition releases.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">CC Site 9.5 Update Information:</p>
                <p>CC Site 9.5 has an updated home page and more. It now features Metro-style buttons to link to secondary links on the website. The older links for the secondary pages have been removed from the home page side bar. The main links still remain in the navigation bar. The Terms page and the Divisions page are still available, but the links are now in the More section. The More section has also had a small design tweak.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">CC Site 9.4 Update Information:</p>
                <p>CC Site 9.4 has a completely redesigned CC Reminder system. There is now more automation built into the form. You don't have to send in emails anymore to apply, you can use the automated form. In addition, a new RSS feed ticker displays on the top of the home page displaying the most recent RSS feed posts.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">CC Site 9.3 Update Information:</p>
                <p>CC Site 9.3 has a new live blog page since the old one can no longer be hosted. It has a clean interface, with a search features, RSS feature, and archive section.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">CC Site 9.2 Update Information:</p>
                <p>CC Site 9.2 has a brand new CCL page to view the live stream and chat in the IRC chat room. We've switched back to USTREAM for CCL now. In addition, the old CCL site is now the CCL Blog site. It will do everything that it did before, except show the live stream. This might change in the future with future website development. Also, the live.thecomputerclan.com subdomain works for the new live site, and the new subdomain, liveblog.thecomputerclan.com, will go to the CCL Blog page. You can also get to that blog page by clicking the Blog button in the navigation bar.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">CC Site 9.1 Update Information:</p>
                <p>CC Site 9.1 is part of the new Computer Clan Social website release. The Social button has now been added to the navigation bar to go to the CCS website.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">CC Site 9.0 Update Information:</p>
                <p>Welcome to CC Site 9.0, the largest CC Site update in the history of the Computer Clan. This page will describe all of the update details.</p>
                <p>A message was sent out saying that all bookmarks of the direct URL of CC Site 8.x will break. Update any of your book marks now if there are any conflicts with your current ones.</p>
                <p>Primary changes:<br>The URL is a lot shorter, but the simple, and easy to remember, domain stayed the same.</p>
                <p>The homepage has been completely redesigned. It has a new section for CCL information, a new color scheme, and all of the RSS feeds are embedded into a sidebar on the right side of the page. </p>
                <p>The navigation bar has been updated. The home button is no longer in there. The home button is when you click the “Computer Clan” text in the banner or the CC logo in the banner when you are on another page.</p>
                <p>The whole site color scheme has been changed to a professional white and light gray style. Also featuring a new font.</p>
                <p>The Computer Clan Live section has been redesigned on a new, open source, CMS. We are no longer using WordPress for it.</p>
