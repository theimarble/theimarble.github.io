        <h1>WWDC 2023 - Thoughts, Raves and Rants</h1>
        <p1>So WWDC 2023 has happened, and I have some thoughts.</p1>
        <div class="postlist">
            <p1><b>Raves</b></p1>
            <ul>
                <li>Vision Pro.</li>
                <li>The 15" M2 Air. I'm really excited to see this in person, as I've been waiting years to see Apple make a lightweight [Air] 15" notebook.</li>
                <li>Updated Mac Studio - The M2 series is only a minor update, but it is nice to see Apple paying attention to the Studio lineup, as some thought that Apple was only using it as a stopgap till the Mac Pro came out.</li>
                <li>iOS 17. Not a huge update like we had last year, but the additions are nice. I've installed the DP onto my SE 2, and will post my thoughts on it later this week.</li>
                <li>watchOS 10. I must admit that I haven't fully watched the watchOS section of the keynote as of writing this post, but yes, the UI has been redesigned with larger widgets.</li>
                <li>Craig Federighi mentioned Apple's crack marketing team!</li>
            </ul>
            <p1><b>Rants</b></p1>
            <ul>
                <li>The new Mac Pro... I'm going to write a larger post on my thoughts about the new M2 Ultra Mac Pro, but to summarise what I'll see, this was a massively disappointing update, at a massively dissappointing price.</li>
                <li>macOS Sonoma is lacking. Yes, I know that these days macOS updates aren't ground-breaking, however it feels that Apple is sidelining macOS in favour of their mobile platforms, and Vision Pro.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p1>In general, 2023 was another good year for WWDC, especially with the launch of the Vision Pro. My next post will most likely be my thoughts on the iOS 17 DP, however so far it has been pretty good.</p1>

        <h1>My Top 5 Picks for WWDC '23</h1>
        <p1>WWDC is only a few days away now, so here are my top picks before the event happens.</p1>
        <div class="postlist">
            <ul>
                <li>Apple will release a VR headset either named "Apple Reality" or "Apple Vision".</li>
                <li>watchOS 10 will be the biggest update to the Apple Watch since its debut in 2015. Widgets similar to the iPhone will be added.</li>
                <li>A 15" MacBook Air will be released, featuring the M2 chip. Starting price will be $1499.</li>
                <li>Alongside macOS 14, the Mac Studio will be updated to feature the M2 Max and M2 Ultra chips. The starting price will stay at $1999.</li>
                <li>Craig Federighi will mention Apple's crack marketing team when announcing macOS 13.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p1>Overall, I'm super excited for this years WWDC, of course we will get the usual OS updates, but hopefully hardware will also be introduced this year too.</p1>
